            //  and make sure we get the expected output

            //automated testing... we write the instructions for a test
            //  and the expected results, then we rerun lots of tests automatically

            //this helps us find and solves bugs quicker for subsequent development
            //it also helps us design well in the first place
            //testable code is better designed code in general

            //unit testing is a particular kind of automated testing
            //  where we resolve to test the smallest pieces we can at a time

            //the alternative would be integration testing where we're testing to make
            //  sure the integrated system works from start to end
