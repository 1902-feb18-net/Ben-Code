## HTML
- Hyper Text Markup Language
- old HTML -> HTML 4 (old to new)
    - Browser wars back then where each browser competed directly with each other rather than working together
    - Each has their own version of HTML
    - Upon moving to HTML 4, HTML became more standard (except for internet explorer)
- HTML 4 -> XHTML
    - XHTML is a subset of XML
        - Error handling is well-defined
        - Web developers are barbarians and wouldn't have it
- HtML 4 -> HTML 5
    - HTML 5 is the modern version
    - A bit of a compromise, does have error handling
    - HTML 5 has a "living standard" and what that is is anyone's guess
- W3C, WWW Consortium
    - Responsible for XHTML
    - Fallen out of relevance
- WHATWG
    - Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group
    - Work to improve consistency of HTML, but in a free-form web-developer-y way
