## Git Organization
- From top to bottom:
    - Remote repository (GitHub)
    - Local repository
    - Index (staging area)
    - Working directory/tree
- Local repository and index both point to the .git folder
- The working directory points towards the license and readme.md
- Version control system (VCS)
- Source control management (SCM) tool
- Git is a distributed VCS (in contrast to other popular VCS)
- Other VCS include:
    - SVN (subversion)
    - Hg (mercurial)
    - TFS (team foundation server)
- In a centralized VCS, there is one system that is connected to everything
- In a distributed VCS, everyone has a copy of the whole repo
- Working directory/tree: Current state of files as far as non-git aware programs can see
- Index: Temporary place to prepare for a commit (after you use git add but before you use git commit)
    - If git reset is called, information goes back to working directory
    - If git diff is called, compares index files with the files in working directory
- Local repository: where commits are stored along with a permanent record of the history of commits
    - If git diff --cached is called, compares information between local repo and index
- Remote repository: Someone else's recrod of history in commits, basically GitHub (reached after Git Push)
    - If Git Pull is used, information from the remote repo is pulled to all three other locations, the working directory, index, and local repo
- Stash: Temporary storage/stack of temporary changes
    - Use git stash to put things on the stash

## Extended Modifiers
 - Class
    - Static
        - Static cannot be instantiated into object
            - meant to be namespace for members, just a container for methods
        - all classes can have static members
            - static classes can only  have static members
    - Virtual
        - Cannot be on class
    - Override
        - Cannot be on class
    - New
        - Cannot be on class
    - Const
        - Cannot be on class
    - Readonly
        - Cannot be on class
    - Abstract
        - Can be a class
        - The only kind of class that can have abstract members
    - Sealed
        - Can be on class
        - Cannot derive classes from it
    - Partial
        - Can be on class
        - A class defined in more than one file
- Member
    - Static
        - Not tied to specific instance or obj, cannot access on any non-static data
    - Virtual
        - Can have on member
    - Override
        - Can be on member
    - New
        - Can be on member
    - Const
        - Can be on member
        - Can't be changed after initialization
    - Readonly
        - Can be on member
        - Similar to const, cannot change valuea after its constructed
        - However, until it has been fully constructed it can be changed
        - Similar to int x {public get; private set; }
    - Abstract
        - Can be on member
    - Sealed
        - Cannot be on member
    - Partial
        - Cannot be on member
