## CSS
- Display property
    - Has a few different values
    - Inline
    - Block
    - Li {display: inline}
        - element... element... element...
    - Inline-block
    - None (deletes element entirely)
- Visibility: hidden
    - Differs from display: none because the latter removes the element entirely while the former merely hides it
- Position property
    - static (default)
    - relative (left, right, top, bottom)
        - Able to shift element
    - absolute (left, right, top, bottom)
        - Not offsetting from relative object position, but relative parent container
    - fixed (left, right, top, bottom)
        - fixes the element to the overall viewport
        - pastes element to window pane (think of annoying adds)
- Layout Tools
    - Flexbox
    - Grid layout (useful for making 2d grid)
    - Column layout
- Properties
    - Color
        - foreground and background color
    - font-family
        - sets type of font (ex: timmes new roman)
        - has generic font options
        - Can set fallbacks, where if target font isn't found, go to next
    - font-weight
        - used for boldface
    - font-style
        - used for italics and simmilar options
    - Width
    - Height
- Inheritance
    - The behavior that some properties when set on an element is also set on all child elements
    - some properties do not follow inheritance
- CSS resets
    - undoes user agent defaults and styles
    - useful for standardizing between browsers so the style will always look the same
    - Normalize.css, a new-ish program that compromises between resetting defaults and using them
        - It removes browser defaults but doesn't set them to 0, just to something more reasonable
- Media query: allows us to have additional rules for the browser
    - Screen aspect ratio
    - Height and width
    - Touchscreen/mouse differences
    - "print preview"
- Adaptive design
    - Write many CSS files, 1 per resolution
- Responsive design
    - Write 1 CSS file, page will automatically reformat without a refresh
    - Often use CSS library to help achieve responsive design
        - Like bootstrap
        - Or zerb foundation
- Bootstrap: 12 column grid
    - easily divisble by 2, 3, 4, and 6
    - usually don't need to break it down more than that
    - just apply classes to elements

## ASP.NET
- IIS Express is a lightweight, self-contained version of IIS optimized for developers.  IIS express makes it easy to use the more current version of IIS to develop and test websites
- ASP: Active Server Pages, aka "web forms"
    - Every page the user can navigate to can have dynamic content
    - .aspx files have special syntax to connect to .NET code behind it
        - syntax inside HTML
        - poor separation of concerns (hard to reuse and test)
    - ASP.NET **MVC** is the modern framework for building web-applications in .NET with strong separation fo concerns using the MVC design pattern.
        - models
            - object oriented data sent to or received from client
        - views
            - the templates for the HTMl
            - display logic
            - all about layout and appearance
                - can include css, js
            - give views their model and render them into HTML
        - controllers
            - object(s) that receive requests from clients
            - marshal the models and views together to construct the response
